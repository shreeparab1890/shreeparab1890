# Hi, I'm Shrikrishna Parab! [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">](https://shrikrishnaparab.tech/)

## I am a Data-Driven, Passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast
Data has always fascinated me. My passion for uncovering insights and answering complex questions with the help of data has led me to the field of Data Science.

I earned a Diploma in Electronics and Communication in 2010, and subsequently completed a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Information Technology in 2013 and worked as a PHP developer. Afterward, I achieved a Master of Technology (MTech) degree in Computer Science in 2016, with a specialization in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I also gained valuable experience in Deep Learning, NLP and Information Retrieval by completing an internship under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/">Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya</a> at the Center for Indian Languages and Technology at IIT Bombay.

Motivated by my passion for tackling new and challenging problems, I founded an IT startup in the service sector in 2016. My startup focused on assisting various businesses in the tourism industry to scale their operations using cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions. In my role as a founder, I was responsible for handling end-to-end projects for clients, utilizing various new technologies as per their requirements. This included everything from project management, coding, and documentation throughout the entire project lifecycle.

After shouldering the responsibilities of a founder and honing my skills as a Full-Stack Developer(MERN Stack, Django) for five years in my startup with many ups and downs, my passion for data science has drawn me back to the field. I am excited to apply my experience and skills to analyze and interpret complex data, uncover valuable insights and develop data-driven solutions.
