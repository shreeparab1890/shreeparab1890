# Hi, I'm Shrikrishna Parab! [<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">](https://shrikrishnaparab.tech/)

## I am a Data-Driven, Passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast
Data has always fascinated me. My passion for uncovering insights and answering complex questions with the help of data has led me to the field of Data Science.

I earned a Diploma in Electronics and Communication in 2010, followed by a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in Information Technology in 2013. My early professional journey began as a PHP developer, where I honed my skills in web technologies. I then pursued a Master of Technology (MTech) in Computer Science in 2016, specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP). During my MTech, I gained valuable experience in Deep Learning, NLP, and Information Retrieval through an internship under the mentorship of Dr. Pushpak Bhattacharyya at the Center for Indian Languages and Technology (CFILT), IIT Bombay.

Motivated by my passion for tackling new and challenging problems, I joined an IT startup in the service sector in 2016. The startup focused on assisting various businesses in the tourism industry to scale their operations using cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions. As a full stack web developer in the startup, I was responsible for handling end-to-end projects, managing the entire lifecycle, from project management and coding to documentation; while leveraging diverse technologies like the MERN Stack and Django.

After eight years of navigating the dynamic world of IT industry, my deep-rooted passion for data science and NLP led me back to research. I have now joined the Department of Computer Science & Technology (DCST), Goa Business School, Goa University, as a PhD student and also a Assistant Professor. My research focuses on the domains of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), MLOps and Language Automations. I am eager to contribute to advancements in these fields, leveraging my expertise to develop innovative solutions that enhance overall user experiences and drive meaningful insights from data.
